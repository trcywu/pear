# About

A date venue discovery platform with a cheeky twist & using Google places API





# The USP


The unique feature is the slider functionality allowing the user to discovery and 'play' with the potential options of dating venues. This is a fun app with the intent to entertain. 


# Planning & Balsamiq
The planning was broken down into three broad areas of researching APIs, wireframing and design mood boarding. 

**APIs** - The APIs that were broadly researched were Kinsey Report, FourSquare, Timeout, Dojo, and designmynight.com

Design mood board - 


**Wireframing** - Balsamiq was used to develop the project wireframes. Wireframes were designed on the smaller iphone screens to ensure responsiveness was taken into consideration.

# Trello Project Management

The planning was then broken down into tasks by day and each individual was delegated areas of responsibility. One person in the team was the dedicated Trello Master to ensure that the team was on track. 

Daily stand ups were held to check in on the progress of the project and potential issues faced and objectives for the day.
